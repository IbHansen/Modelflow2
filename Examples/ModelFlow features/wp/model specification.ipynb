    "\n",
    "1. **Clarity and focus** – The specification remains close to the underlying economic logic, expressed in a concise and readable form. The modeler concentrates on *what the relationships are*, not on *how the computer solves them*.  \n",

    "2. **Expressiveness** – The DSL uses syntax familiar to economists (equations, lags, variables), avoiding the clutter of general-purpose programming constructs.  \n",

    "3. **Maintainability** – Models can be extended or updated without rewriting solution code. Changing an equation is as simple as editing one line in the specification.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Portability** – Once specified, the same model can be executed with different numerical engines or platforms without altering its economic content.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Transparency** – The separation makes models easier to review, validate, and communicate, since the specification reads like economic theory rather than computer code.  \n",

    "This approach is common in several econometric systems such as **EViews**, **Dynare**, and **GEKKO**, which all use their own DSLs to describe models.  \n",

    "**ModelFlow** follows a similar philosophy but with a key difference: it does not introduce a new language for data handling, visualization, or model analysis. Instead, ModelFlow relies on the **Python ecosystem** - primarily `pandas`, but also `networkx`, `sympy`, `numpy`, and other libraries - allowing the model specification to be combined seamlessly with powerful tools for data manipulation, result analysis, and visualization.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- `list BANKS = ...` defines a top-level list of banks with an **sublist** `bankcountry` that specifies where each bank belongs.  \n",
    "- `list country = ...` creates a country list.  \n",
    "- `list ports = ...` groups portfolios (`households`, `NFC`, `RE`, `sov`) and creates **sublists** with regulatory categories (`AIRB`, `STA`).  \n",
    "- `list country__danske`, `list country__nordea`, and `list country__ibs` are **lists**, linking each bank to its loan countries.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of lists: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Compactness** – groups can be declared once and reused throughout the model.  \n",
    "- **Flexibility** – adding or removing members requires only updating the list, not the equations.  \n",
    "- **Transparency** – clear structure makes it easy to see which entities and attributes the model covers.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The **`do ... enddo`** construct allows repetitive patterns of equations to be generated automatically.  \n",

    "\n",
    "A `do` block defines a **loop** over the members of a specified list (for example, all banks, sectors, or countries).  \n",
    "Within the block, the loop variable can be referenced directly inside formulas — ModelFlow will automatically substitute the appropriate member name during expansion.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism is essential for large-scale models where the same behavioral relationships apply to multiple entities.  \n",
    "It ensures **consistency**, reduces **repetition**, and makes model specifications more **maintainable** and **transparent**.  \n",
