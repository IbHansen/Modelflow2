Creating a Macro prudential model often entails recycling several models specified in different ways: Excel, Latex, Dynare, Python or other languages.

    "##  Introduction \n",
    "The main purpose of ModelFlow is to bring a model and a data set together. Then the model can be solved, and the results analyzed and\n",
    "compared. The user can do this either with the Python methods that ModelFlow will wrap around the model, or by by using the many datascience tools provided by the Python ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Models can be specified in a high level Business logic language (a Domain Specific language)**. This allows the formulation of a model in a concise and expressive language which is close to the economic of the model. The user can concentrate on the economic or financial content - not the coding of the solution. The code for solving the model is generated by the tool. \n",
    "\n",
    " - a model can be *simultaneous* or *non-simultaneous*\n",
    " - a model can be specified as a normalized model - $y = F(y,x)$,or a general form model - $0=G(y,x)$  \n",
    " - simultaneous models can be solved by:\n",
    "     - Gauss-Seidle or Newton-Raphson algorithmes if no leads - ie the formulas are recurrence \n",
    "     - Fair-Taylor or stacked Newton-Raphson if the model contains leads \n",
    "     - The jacobian matrice used by Newton-Raphson solvers will can be calculated either by symbolic differentiation or by numerical differentiation \n",
    " - non-simultaneous models will be sequenced and calculated. \n",
    " - variables in a model can be scalars or matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the\n",
    "model is not initially specified in the Business logic language, Python\n",
    "offers a wide range of possibilities to grab a model and transform it to\n",
    "the Business logic language. Also, models in the form of Matlab\n",
    "functions can be wrapped and called from ModelFlow. This allows for the recycling and integration models sourced from a number of different origins. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a model **flows** through a number of phases, from a formulation in business logic language to a Python program which can solve the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ModelFlow is written in Python**. Python comes \"batteries included\" and is\n",
    "the basis of a very rich ecosystem, which consists of a wide array of\n",
    "libraries. ModelFlow is just another library. It supplements the existing\n",
